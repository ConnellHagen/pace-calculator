# About
This is a calculator that allows for the calculation of the average running pace among intervals. This is especially useful for run workouts like Fartleks
and track repeats where there are rest periods between the active periods of work.

Fartlek Example (actual workout of mine)                                                                      |Track Workout Example (NOT an actual workout of mine!!)

# Usage
This program was made using the Windows Presentation Foundation, and so it is made for Windows. Using an emulator like Wine may work, but I have not tested it.

The `.exe` file to run this application can be found in the `Releases` tab on this GitHub page. Download either the `Framework-Dependent` or `Self-Contained` version
of this software. To run the `Framework-Dependent`, .NET 7.0 (recommended version) should be installed on your computer first for this program to work. The `Self-Contained`
version is a larger file size, but it will work without .NET installed. Once downloaded, extract the folder within the `.zip` into your Program Files folder, 
Desktop, or wherever you wish to keep this program installed. To run the program, simply run the `.exe` in the folder, and it should run. If you have any 
problems with this, please open an Issue.

# Updates
Planned updates include: 
- Mile/Kilometer pace conversion (to aid in getting a good idea of what a pace is when talking to Br*tish people. Or I guess you could use it vice versa maybe... whatever. I tend to avoid talking to Europeans for this reason alone.)
- Training pace estimation using a time trial/PB, and scientific recommendations for the relative speeds for various training paces.
