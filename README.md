# About
This is a calculator that allows for the calculation of the average running pace among intervals. This is especially useful for run workouts like Fartleks
and track repeats where there are rest periods between the active periods of work.

Fartlek Example (actual workout of mine)                                                                      |Track Workout Example

# Usage
The executable file will soon be made and posted in the `Releases` section. This project is made using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
and so this will only work natively on Windows, except with usage of an emulation software.

# License
This project is free for any non-commercial usage. Please contact me if you would like to use this software in a way that is commercial or not clear.

# Updates
Planned updates include: 
- The ability to find average pace using different information, such as pace (Apple watch gives a more accurate pace than
distance to work with than distance for shorter Fartleks.
- Toggleable dark mode.
- Mile/Kilometer conversion.
